Welcome to **twini** — a **tiny powerhouse** of digital creativity based in France.  
We design, build, and ship **custom digital experiences** with a love for detail, structure, and a touch of chaos (the good kind).

_Our logo is a T. Or a click. Or both. Either way, it slaps._

## 🚧 What we actually do

| Feature            | What it feels like                          |
|--------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| `Web dev`          | Like magic, but debugged                    |
| `Visual identity`  | From "meh" to "woah" in one concept round   |
| `SEO`              | The opposite of being invisible             |
| `Social media`     | Crafted posts without the 🤮                |
| `The secret sauce` | Strategy, UX, code love, pixel sorcery     |

We don’t "deliver" projects. We **craft them**.  
We polish the edges. We commit with messages like: `fix: added ✨ because why not`

## ☕️ Let’s talk if...

- Your digital presence feels like a haunted Word doc
- You want a site that doesn't scream "2013 template"
- You’re building something great and need the web part to match
- You like teams that listen, laugh, and deliver
- You believe good design is a feature, not a finish

## 🌀 Last words

We're not some massive factory of vague solutions.  
We're an **independent, curious, craft-level studio** that loves challenges, pixels and punchlines.

```js
setInterval(() => {
  buildSomethingAwesome();
}, 42);
```
